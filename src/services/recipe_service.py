            Make sure the recipe:
            1. Uses primarily the provided ingredients
            2. Is appropriate for the specified skill level
            3. Respects dietary restrictions
            4. Uses the available cooking appliances
            5. Follows the cuisine preference when possible
            6. Includes accurate nutritional estimates
            7. Provides a practical shopping list for missing ingredients
            8. CRITICAL: Ensures ALL ingredients are properly cooked - especially:
               - Lentils, beans, and legumes (need 20-45 min cooking time)
               - Rice, quinoa, and grains (need proper cooking/boiling)
               - Raw meats and poultry (must reach safe internal temperatures)
               - Root vegetables (need adequate cooking time)
            9. CRITICAL: Instructions must be COMPLETE and include:
               - Every step from start to finish
               - Specific cooking times and methods for each ingredient
               - Temperatures where applicable
               - Preparation details (chopping, seasoning, etc.)
               - Do NOT truncate or abbreviate the instructions
            10. Verify that no ingredient is left uncooked when it should be cooked
            
            IMPORTANT: Provide COMPLETE step-by-step instructions. Do not abbreviate or summarize. Each step should be detailed enough for someone to follow exactly.
